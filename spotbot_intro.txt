I'm Chum Bot, the ruling authority of chums on behalf of IVPs.

- `chum`, `chummed`: Log your chums with people by mentioning them in a message with the keyword `chum` or `chummed` and a picture of your spot. 
- `chumboard`: Show how many times each channel member has chummed someone else. 
- `pics`: View all pics of a person by tagging them in a message with the `pics` keyword. 
- `referendum`: Reply `referendum` to a chum to start a 24-hour vote to determine if the chum will count or not. 
- `reset`: Reset the chum record in a channel. 


Tips
- Look out for :white_check_mark:. If you don't see :white_check_mark:, your chum didn't count!
- If you didn't chum something correctly, you can edit your message within one minute of sending it to correct the error. 
- If you delete a message, the chum will no longer count! 
- Chumbot will treat each channel of the workspace separately so different teams can maintain their own chum boards.
