# spot-bot

Spot Bot is the relentless accountant of the surreptitious photos you take of each other. 

- `spot`, `spotted`: Spot people by mentioning them in a message with the keyword `spot` or `spotted` and a picture of your spot. 
- `spotboard`: Show how many times each channel member has spotted someone else. 
- `caughtboard`: Show how many times each channel member has been spotted.
- `pics`: View all pics of a person by tagging them in a message with the `pics` keyword. 
- `referendum`: Reply `referendum` to a spot to start a 24-hour vote to determine if the spot will count or not. 
- `reset`: Reset the spot record in a channel. 


### Tips
- Look out for :white_check_mark:. If you don't see :white_check_mark:, your spot didn't count!
- If you didn't spot something correctly, you can edit your message within one minute of sending it to correct the error. 
- If you delete a message, the spot will no longer count! 
- Spotbot will treat each channel of the workspace separately so different teams can maintain their own spot boards.
